# RISC_V_Microprocessor_Design
RISCV design in VHDL for my Micropressor Design Class. Each lab has a report with it to expalin everything. All of these were implemented on a Nexys A7-100T (Xilinx ArtixÂ®-7 FPGA family).

In each lab folder, there is a pdf call <something>_report.pdf. That is a good place to start for each lab.
